# openlibrary-lite
Mobile first "lite" Open Library

Available now at http://openlibrary-lite.pages.archivelab.org


## Running the app:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To build your app for deployment, run:

```
npm run build
```

The build folder will then contain all of your app's files, optimized and ready for deployment.

This template was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It is suggested that you read more about Create React App to understand the full capabilities of the toolset.


## Contributing

There is still work to be done to finish the original design. See
https://github.com/ArchiveLabs/openlibrary-lite/issues/3

For example, a bottom navbar still needs to be implemented, and so does user account integration.
